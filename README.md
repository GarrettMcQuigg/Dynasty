### My application is designed to be a visual representation for my friend group's fantasy football league

### API = https://docs.sleeper.com/

   The applciation was built using React.js and TailwindCSS. The API from sleeper.com returned datasets that required complex manipulation/algorithms in order to return the desired values and display them in the app.

  The site has a clean UI that allows the user to see a ranking list, weekly article, and standings list. The standings list is built dynamically so when you click on a team, it will return more information abhout that specific team on it's own page.
